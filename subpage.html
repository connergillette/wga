          <p>It looks like I can get 120 circular 1.5" stickers with our logo on it for 8 bucks. Obviously we don't have to do stickers but that seems like a great way to not spend very much and have something for people to pay for. What do you guys think?
          I can also get 48 stickers for $3.19, etc. Prices are super reasonable.
          If, by some miracle, we hear back from Valve and they have stuff we can raffle off or something, that seems like the best option, but I'm trying to plan for our more likely scenario.</p>
